## Installing Illegalcord

### Dependencies

[Git](https://git-scm.com/download) and [Node.JS LTS](https://nodejs.dev/en/) are required.

Install `pnpm`:

> :exclamation: This next command may need to be run as admin/root depending on your system, and you may need to close and reopen your terminal for pnpm to be in your PATH.

```shell
npm i -g pnpm
```

> :exclamation: **IMPORTANT** Make sure you aren't using an admin/root terminal from here onwards. It **will** mess up your Discord/Illegalcord instance and you **will** most likely have to reinstall.

Clone Illegalcord:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ImHisako/Illegalcord
cd Illegalcord
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Build Illegalcord:

```

Inject Illegalcord into your desktop client:

```shell
pnpm inject
```

Build Illegalcord for web:

```shell
pnpm buildWeb
```

After building Illegalcord's web extension, locate the appropriate ZIP file in the `dist` directory and follow your browser’s guide for installing custom extensions, if supported.

Note: Firefox extension zip requires Firefox for developers

<summary>Using Illegalcord violates Discord's terms of service</summary>

Client modifications are against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine if you don’t use plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use!

Regardless, if your account is essential to you and getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Equicord), just to be safe.

Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with Equicord in a server where you might get banned for it.

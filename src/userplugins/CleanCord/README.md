## Installation
**Prerequiries** : [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) / [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) / [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- Open a CMD window, you will need a clone of Vencord's Repository, command : `git clone https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord`
- Navigate to the path where you cloned the repository (Ex : "`cd C:\Documents\Vencord`") then type : `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- Inside the 'Vencord' Folder, navigate to "`.\src\`" and create a new folder called "**userplugins**"

## FAQ

**❓: Do hidden servers still show notifications?**
- No, hidden servers won't display unread messages, mention counts or play notifications sounds.
(Only when **Suppresion Mode** is set to <ins>Silent</ins> & (Preferably) **Auto Clear Mentions** is <ins>enabled</ins>)

**❓: Can I still access hidden servers?**
- Yes, you can still access them through Quick Switcher (Ctrl+K), joining one of your friends' activity, etc... or by unhiding them in settings.

**❓: Does this plugin breaks interaction with hidden servers?**
- No, people from any hidden server can still interact with you and vise versa. The "icons" Discord displays in the server listing are only hidden with Custom CSS injection.

**❓ : Will people know I'm using CleanCord?**
- No, this is purely a visual change on your client. Moreover, there is a setting to completely hide CleanCord's right-click options!
(Same goes whilst streaming, by enabling the option, CleanCord will silently hide your hidden elements the moment **Streamer Mode** is on)

**❓: Will my hidden elements stay hidden after restarting Discord?**
- Yes, your preferences are saved between sessions thanks to Vencord!

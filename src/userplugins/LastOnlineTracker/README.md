# 🕐 LastOnlineTracker

**A [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord) plugin that tracks when Discord users were last online.**

Shows a *"last seen X ago"* label below usernames in the member list and in right-click menus — completely client-side, resets every restart.

## ✨ Features

- **Below-username label** — shows `🕐 5m ago` directly under a user's name in the member list
- **Auto-updates** — refreshes every 60 seconds without needing to reload Discord
- **Client-side only** — no servers, no databases, no external requests
- **Resets on restart** — intentionally ephemeral; closing Discord wipes all data
- **Works in servers and DMs**

## 🎮 Usage

Once enabled, the plugin works automatically:

### Member List
Users who go offline while you have Discord open will show a `🕐 Xm ago` label below their username in the right-hand member panel.
 
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  🟢 OnlineUser              │
│                             │
│  ⚫ OfflineUser             │
│     🕐 12m ago              │  ← appears here
│                             │
│  ⚫ AnotherUser             │
│     🕐 2h ago               │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```


```
──────────────────
  Last seen 5m ago
  04/21/2026, 14:32:07
```


### Important: When data appears
- Data only accumulates **during the current session**
- A user must go **online then offline** while you're watching for them to be tracked
- Users who were already offline when you started Discord won't show until they next reconnect and disconnect
- All data is **wiped when Discord closes**

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
Discord Presence Event
        │
        ▼
  PRESENCE_UPDATES
  (Flux dispatcher)
        │
        ├── status === "offline"?
        │   └── clientStatus empty?
        │           │
        │           ▼
        │     Save timestamp
        │     to Map<userId, timestamp>
        │
        ▼
   React components
   read from Map and
   re-render every 60s
```

The plugin subscribes to Discord's internal `PRESENCE_UPDATES` Flux event using Vencord's built-in `flux` handler. When a user's status transitions to `"offline"` with no active clients (desktop, web, or mobile), the current Unix timestamp is stored in a plain JavaScript `Map`.

Two display surfaces read from this map:
1. **`addMemberListDecorator`** — injects a React component into member list rows
2. **`addContextMenuPatch`** — appends a menu item to user right-click menus

The `Map` is never persisted to disk. Calling `stop()` or restarting Discord calls `lastSeenMap.clear()`.

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Nothing shows in the member list**
- Make sure the plugin is **enabled** in Settings → Plugins
- Users only appear after they go offline **during your current session**
- Try opening a small server where you can see presence changes

**Build fails with "No matching export"**
- Check your Vencord version: `git log --oneline -5` from the Vencord root
- Run `git pull && pnpm install && pnpm build` to update Vencord
- If errors persist, open an issue and paste the full build error

**"Not tracked yet" in right-click menu**
- That user hasn't gone offline while you've had Discord open this session
- Keep Discord open and wait for them to disconnect

**Plugin shows in settings but badge is missing**
- The below-name patch may have stopped matching due to a Discord update
- The right-side badge (decorator) should still work as a fallback
- Open an issue with your Vencord version and I'll fix the patch (hopefully)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- This plugin is **client-side only** — it cannot track users you can't already see presence for
- Large servers (250+ members) have limited presence data from Discord
- Discord's Terms of Service technically prohibit client modifications, though bans are essentially unheard of for passive plugins like this
- All tracked data stays in your RAM and is never shared
